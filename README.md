INTRODUCTION
------------

This program mines a Bureau of Transportation Statistics database to visualize ticket price trends over the past few decades.

The first feature shows the ticket price (raw and inflation-adjusted) percent change between two specific years at any specific airport. It also shows the national average ticket price (raw and inflation-adjusted) percent change between two specific years.

The second feature visualizes the national average ticket prices over the past few decades by inputing "NATIONAL". The feature also visualizes the ticket prices over the past few
decades at a specific airport by inputting the specific airport code (example: "LAX"). Two lines representing raw and inflation-adjusted prices will be shown.

Majority of the results support that demand for air travel is dangerously rising as prices drastically fall. This will lead to an increase in plane usage and therefore pollution.
